Course Description: Introduction to computer programming in Python emphasizing algorithms for scientific applications and data analysis. 
Prerequisites: Grade of C or better in MAT 121 or 145 or consent of the school advisor.


# Course Purpose:
This course will enable students to solve simple problems and perform basic data analyses by creating programs in Python or R. 
This course is intended for students with little or no programming experience. The course will help students learn programming concepts, data types, structures, and files, loading and storage of data, random generators and basic distributions, and simple statistical analysis and plotting in Python or R.


# Student Objectives:
Upon completion of this course, students should be able to

1.	Design a solution to a problem.
2.	Select and use appropriate data types to solve a problem in Python.
3.	Employ appropriate control structures to solve a problem in Python.
4.	Choose appropriate data structures to solve a problem in Python.
5.	Create re-usable programs through defining simple functions.
 
6.	Use arrays to solve numeric problems in Python.
7.	Create programs that read and write files in Python.
8.	Test and document Python programs.
9.	Use elementary numeric techniques.
10.	Evaluate simple datasets by calculating their descriptive statistics
11.	Experiment with simple charts and diagrams and choose an appropriate type for the problem at hand.
12.	Apply machine learning modeling techniques for data predictions
13.	Experiment with data analysis packages in Python, R, and SQL

# Textbook:
Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython 2nd Edition by Wes McKinney - ISBN-10: 1449319793 -ISBN-13: 978-1449319793

# Assignments: 
There will be a number of programming assignments during the semester. Solutions must adhere to the design, coding and documentation standards 
presented in class. For each programming assignment, you will submit the source code along with any required documentation using ReggieNet. Programs 
containing syntax errors will receive failing grades. Those producing run- time errors will incur a substantial penalty.

Programming assignments must be submitted by midnight of the due date. Late programs will be accepted, however, the value of a program will decrease by
10% of the total points possible for the program for each calendar day (24 hours) that it is late. Programs may be turned in up to three days late unless 
special arrangements have been made with the instructor. After that, they will not be accepted. Do not make a habit of turning programs in late.

# Labs: 
You are required to attend the weekly lab associated with this course. Thirty five percent of your course grade will be from laboratory activities. 
Plan to stay for the entire two-hour lab period every week.

# Exams: 
Two mid-term exams will be given during the semester. The final exam / Final class project (submission) will be given during the last weeks of the semester.
All exams will be cumulative.

# Evaluation

Your grade will be determined based on the following distribution:
2-Midterm exams	20%
Labs	35%
Final exam / Class Project	15%
Programming Assignments	30%
Total	100%
Your grade is computed as a weighted average based on the percentages above. It is not your total points divided by the total number of points possible in the course.
 
The grading scale for this course is:
A	90-100
B	80- 89
C	70- 79
D	60- 69
F	Below 60


# Plagiarism and other forms of cheating

You are encouraged to study together for assignments and exams. However, knowingly turning in work that you did not do is plagiarism, 
the most common form of cheating. It is unacceptable in this course and a foolish way to try to get through the course. Note that if you found the code on 
the web (or anywhere else), you did not do the work. Any case of cheating will result in a minimum penalty of a zero on the assignment. This applies to both 
the person who did the work and made it available and the person who copied. The maximum penalty will be an F in the course and pursuit of further disciplinary action. 
Note that the standard penalty for any kind of cheating on a program is a zero on the program in question and a loss of 10% on the final course average. All cheating will be 
reported to CRR as required by university policy.
